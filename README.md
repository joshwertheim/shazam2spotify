Plan: get saved tags from OSX Shazam app and automatically add them to a Spotify playlist.

The issue I have with the Shazam OS X application is that there is no way to automatically add discovered songs to Spotify. Its iOS app on the other hand does have this feature.

Thought it would be a fun project to tackle and become more familiar with using SQLite, which is what Shazam is storing tag data in.

##TODOs
1. Make program persistent, keep track of updates, etc. Probably use Z_PK tag ID.
2. Add Spotify support
